A player to play Mohawk based games.

**Note:** This file is formatted in Markdown but can be read in any Amiga text editor.

## Compiling

Mohawk uses the [Bebbo Amiga GCC Toolchain](https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc) to compile. 
Although this software may be compiled with a compatible Amiga C++ compiler. Make sure that the 
tool chain is in your path, and run make on the source drawer.

For example:

```sh
export PATH="/opt/amiga/bin:$PATH"
make
```

## Running

Copy the appropriate data files into the Mohawk installation drawer, and launch the Mohawk
executable from Workbench.
